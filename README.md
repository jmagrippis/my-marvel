## Running locally

### Prep

You will need a version of Node installed: it is recommended to use [nvm] for hassle-free node version management.

[Yarn v1] is recommended for installing this project's dependencies. [npm] which would have been installed alongside node should work almost just as well.

Assuming you went with yarn, go to the root of the project and run:

```sh
yarn
```

... and everything you need to run this project and its tests will be downloaded for you. Prep complete!

[nvm]: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm 'bash script to manage multiple active node.js versions'
[yarn v1]: https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install 'because they dropped the ball with v2'
[npm]: https://www.npmjs.com/ 'it once was THE javascript package manager'

### Starting the dev server

If you clone this project and go to the root directory, running:

```sh
yarn dev
```

Will spin up the dev server, running on port 3600.

### Running tests

Regardless if youâ€™ve got the server running, the following command will start the test runner:

```sh
yarn test --watch
```

Tests will rerun when any code changes.

The testing framework of choice is [Jest] and [React Testing Library] is also setup, and heavily recommended for the UI testing.
